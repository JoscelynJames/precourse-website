          <h3>Backgroud</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">
          I go by Jo or Josce for short, but I will respond to pretty much anything.
          I am Colorado born and raised. I am the youngest of my family with 3
          older brothers and an older sister. Two of my brothers went through
          Galvanize and are web developers for different companies; they helped
          spark my interest in coding and Galvanize. Then I have my crazy dog,
          Missy(pictured below). She is an Aussie that loves to talk and go
          for car rides. Maybe I will get to bring her in one day! I have an
          amazingly weird boyfriend with an equally weird and amazing bird(also
          pictured below). You will probably get to see him around galvanize.

        <h3>My Coding Background</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">I have been seriously coding sense the beginning of
          this year. I dabbled in Codecadamy a couple years back and never thought
          this would be a career path I could do. Everything I learned wasn't
          sticking and I instantly thought that it was because of me and my brain
          wasn’t capable of learning these languages. It wasn’t until I got a push
          from my boyfriend and one of my brothers to learn more. They really believed
          I would enjoy programming and love it as my job. I have been in the
          service industry for all of my career and I think now is the time for
          change. </p>
          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">
          During my free time, I love to be in the mountains. Whether it's camping,
          hiking, ATV, off roading, snowboarding, or kayaking, I do it all. I own
          a 2003 Toyota 4runner that helps me on all of these adventures. I also
          love to play video games. I lost about 8 years of my life to a World Of
          Warcraft addiction(For the Horde!). With that being said, I love RPGs
          and games with a good story line and have endless things for me to
          collect and waste hours upon hours on :).
