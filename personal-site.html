          <h3>Backgroud</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">
          My name is Joscelyn James, I go by Jo or Josce for short, but I will
          respond to pretty much anything. I am colorado born and raised. I am the
          youngest of my family with 3 older brothers and an older sister. Two of
          my brothers went through Galvanize and are web developers for differnt
          companies; they helped spark my interest in coding and Galvanize. Then I
          have my crazy dog, Missy(pictured below). She is an aussie that
          loves to talk and go for car rides. Maybe I will get to bring her in
          one day! I have an amazingly weird boyfriend with an equally weird and
          amazing bird(also pictured below). You will probably get to see
          him around galvanize.

        <h3>My Coding Background</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">I have been seriously coding sense the beginning of this year. I
          dabbeled in Codecadamy a couple years back and never thought this would
          be a carrer path I could do. Everything I learned wasn't sticking and I
          intasntly thought that it was because of me and my brain wasnt capable
          of learning these languages. It wasnt until I got a push
          from my boyfriend and one of my brothers, who are both Software engineers,
          to learn more. They really belived I would enjoy programming and love it
          as my job. I have been in the service industry for all of my carrer
          and I think now is the time for change. </p>
          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="about-me-p">
          During my free time, I love to be in the mountains. Whether it's camping,
          hiking, atv, off roading, snowboarding, or kayaking, I do it all. I own
          a 2003 Toyota 4runner that helps me on all of these adventures. I also
          love to play viedogames. I lost about 8 years of my life to a World Of
          Warcraft addiction(For the Horde!). With that being said, I love RPGs and
          games with a good story line and have endelss things for me to collect
          and waste hours upon hours on :).
