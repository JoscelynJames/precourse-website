        <h2>I'm as excited as this mini pony running on the beach to start Galvanize!</h2>

          <p> Im ready to take a huge step, to start my carrer as a web developer,
          and really learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. I am also
          really looking foward to ending my career as a Waitress. After this
          program I intend to get a job as a web developer (hopefully) at a
          startup compnay. I love the passion of the people at startups because
          they belive in the product they are selling. You don't get that cog-
          in-the-wheel feeling. But yet I am still a child in this feild and
          might come to change my mind. I look foward to be challenged throughout
          this next 6 months and hope to learn more than just web development.</p>
          <p> After I have mastered web development, I would like to look into
            creating viedogames for fun. I have always loved and been facinated
            by them.
